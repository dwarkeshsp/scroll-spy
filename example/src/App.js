      "This fall, we're releasing an online community for homeschooling kids, where we host interest-based clubs. Our clubs connect academic lessons to the real world through projects that kids explore on their own or with their families. In our current clubs, students are building vehicles using rubber bands, writing stories with original characters, designing computer games from scratch, and exploring the natural world around them.",
      "When students create accounts on Primer's website, they can join clubs right away and pick a few projects to work on independently from our library.",
      'As learners progress through a project, they can post updates on their progress, ask questions, and request feedback from Primer admins and other club members.',

As passionate lifelong learners, we play-test every single project that we publish, so we get excited every time a student approaches a project in their own unique way."

      'For parents, projects are an open-ended delivery system for a meaningful, buildable, hands-on education. For kids, projects are introductions to the world and a first taste at making their mark on it. For families, projects are adventures that everyone can contribute to and celebrate together. As we build for the long term, our curricula will expand to include other styles of learning and content delivery.',

      'Can I use this as my core curriculum?',
      "Primer's clubs are a rich supplement to core curricula, but we're working on building a complete curriculum.",

      'What ages is Primer for?',
      'Primer is ideal for students ages 7 - 14, but older and younger students can enjoy Primer too. Younger students may need help from a family member to navigate the projects, and older students may want to augment the projects for an additional challenge. We‚Äôll have dedicated content for younger and older students coming out soon!',

      'Is this program religious or secular?',
      'We get this question a lot. The short answer is that we don‚Äôt take any religious stances in Primer content and we‚Äôre pro-science. We believe that, for every decision around your child‚Äôs education, parents are best equipped to decide if or when to introduce religion within the context of education.',

      'Wait, were any of you actually homeschooled?',
      'Funny you should ask! We are built by homeschoolers for homeschoolers. Ryan, our CEO and Co-Founder was homeschooled for 9 years from Kindergarten through 8th grade. Maksim, our CTO, skipped traditional school in high school so that he could study as much physics as he wanted.',

      'Okay, I love it. How can I help?',
      'Thank you! We‚Äôve been blown away by how many families have reached out asking how they can help. Spreading the word about Primer within your homeschooling communities ‚Äî on Facebook, Instagram, via email, and in person ‚Äî is incredibly valuable. We‚Äôre a small team and we rely heavily on word of mouth. We so appreciate you spreading the word!',

      'We‚Äôre also hiring! If you see a role that seems like a fit, we‚Äôd love to chat with you.',

      'Have something else in mind? Email us! we‚Äôre always happy to chat and hear ideas!',
